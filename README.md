# Inference-Analysis-Tool

This tool allows a user to infere an entire validation set in an automated process.

Besides automating the inference on a predefined set (not live images), the tool also allows:
- View the total scores'results in a graph
- Set outlier percentage and view outlier scores and images

Oh, there's a bonus: The tool has a GUI!
